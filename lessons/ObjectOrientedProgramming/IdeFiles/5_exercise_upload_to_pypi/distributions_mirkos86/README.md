# distributions package

This is a very, very simple package that can provide the elementary 
properties and plots of the Gaussian and Binomial distributions.

Uploading it to PyPi is part of the exercise for the Object Oriented Programming Module
of the Data Science Nanodegree, Term 2, on Udacity.
